Advice, biggest problem and my unresolved problem

If I were to start this project all over again, I would do it in p5.play as my collision wouldn't have taken up majority of my time and I could focus on other aspects of the game. Overall it was the conerversion between my 2D array map and pac mans x and y coordinates. I attempted conversion both ways, inserting a pac man png, a pac man square, p5.collide 2D library and attempted to install p5.play as a last ditch effort(said it was blocked and wouldn't allow me to use any functions{tried installing through ctrl + shift + p and manually pasting into html}).
This project isn't a reflection of my best work as I got really caught up on trying to make something work that still, after hours and hours and the end of the project is still not to my standards. I believe it doesnt reflect the amount of time spent on it due to all the changes and hours I spent on it without commiting as it ended up as a fail. I believe if I was able to just get a good base going(with the movement) I would be able to take this project so much further and achieve all my nice to have features.
At the end of the day this is what I'm handing in and to be honest I'm pretty embarrassed by it but just wanted to be honest as I just wanted you to know that this doesnt reflect what I learned this year. I promise this isn't for pity marks I will obviously accept what this project deserves it just didn't sit right with me to not say anything and overall just wanted you to know that I tried.
