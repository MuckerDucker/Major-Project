# Proposal

Description of what I'm going to do

## Needs to Have List

- Pac-man movement(WASD)
- Ghost AI different enough for four ghosts(AI to chase and run from Pac-man)
- Grid background
- Food power-up
- Can tell when all the pellets have been eaten
- Code sending back Ghosts after being eaten
- Pac-man Animation

## Nice to Have List

- Ghost animation(colour to blink faster when the power-up is running out)
- Different levels
- Code letting one ghost out periodically
