# Proposal

I am going to recreate Pac-Man. 

## Needs to Have List

- Pac-man movement(WASD)
- Ghost AI different enough for four ghosts(AI to chase and run from Pac-man)
- Power-up pellets
- Can advance levels when conditions are met
- Code sending back Ghosts after being eaten

## Nice to Have List

- Pac-man Animation
- Ghost animation(colour to blink faster when the power-up is running out)
- Different levels
- Code for letting one ghost out periodically
- Ghost house reincarnates ghosts from eyeball form


## Questions for chat

- do you think animation is achieveable in a 2Darray?
